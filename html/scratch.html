        <h4>Verse 1:</h4>
        Well, I’m sittin' at the table, it's a late-night crave,
        <br>Got a plate of golden nuggies, I don’t know how to behave.
        <br>Dip 'em in that honey mustard, yeah, they’re tastin' just right,
        <br>Gonna eat 'em all up, baby, ‘cause I’m feelin' like a fight.
        <br>
        <br><h4>Chorus:</h4>
        Chicken nuggies, crispy and fried,
        <br>Savin' me from hunger with every bite I take inside.
        <br>Oh, they may be small, but they sure are mighty,
        <br>I ain't needin’ no salad, just pass me them nuggies, baby!
        <br>
        <br><h4>Verse 2:</h4>
        Gravy on the side, a little ranch for the dip,
        <br>When I’m munchin’ on these nuggies, man, I feel like I might flip.
        <br>Chick-fil-A’s got nothin'—their nuggets just don't stand,
        <br>I’ll take mine extra crispy, not a soggy nugget in hand!
        <br>
        <br><h4>Chorus:</h4>
        Chicken nuggies, crispy and fried,
        <br>Savin' me from hunger with every bite I take inside.
        <br>Oh, they may be small, but they sure are mighty,
        <br>I ain't needin’ no salad, just pass me them nuggies, baby!
        <br>
        <br><h4>Verse 3:</h4>
        Now Chick-fil-A’s fine, but their nuggies ain't the same,
        <br>They’re smaller than my hopes and dreams, and that’s a real shame.
        <br>I need a nugget that’ll stick to my ribs, make me feel alive,
        <br>Not some nugget that's so tiny, you might just swallow it whole by five!
        <br>
        <br><h4>Chorus:</h4>
        Chicken nuggies, crispy and fried,
        <br>Savin' me from hunger with every bite I take inside.
        <br>Oh, they may be small, but they sure are mighty,
        <br>I ain't needin’ no salad, just pass me them nuggies, baby!
        <br>
        <br><h4>Verse 4:</h4>
        Well, my stomach’s feelin' happy, and my heart’s feelin' full,
        <br>A plate of chicken nuggies, now that’s my idea of cool.
        <br>When life gets tough, and I'm feelin’ low,
        <br>I’ll just reach for a nugget and let the good times flow!
        <br>
        <br><h4>Chorus:</h4>
        Chicken nuggies, crispy and fried,
        <br>Savin' me from hunger with every bite I take inside.
        <br>Oh, they may be small, but they sure are mighty,
        <br>I ain't needin’ no salad, just pass me them nuggies, baby!
